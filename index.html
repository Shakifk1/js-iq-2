    <h3> what is creation phase and what is execution phase</h3>
    <p>1.In the creation phase, the Execution Context is first associated with an Execution Context Object (ECO). The Execution Context Object stores a lot of important data which the code in the Execution Context uses during its run-time.<br>
    2.After you've completed the creation step, you'll move on to the execution phase. The JS engines scan over the function in the code one more time, updating the variable object with the values of the variables and then running the code, which is known as an execution phase.</p>

    <h3>what are objects </h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</p>

    <h3>what are function constructor</h3>
    <p>A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.</p>
